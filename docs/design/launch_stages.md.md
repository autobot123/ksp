# Designing Launch Vehicles

Provided you've done at least a half-assed job of eliminating unnecessary drag during construction you want to turn as quickly as you can without blowing up/crashing into
the ground. The speed of your turn is mainly determined by your TWR. You want to get your turn just right from the beginning and then lock in surface prograde for the rest of the flight.

Some rules of thumb for easy, efficient rockets:

## Design
- Make it streamlined, fairing is your friend
- Use two stages with ~1500-1600m/s each
- Aim for a TWR on the first stage of 1.3-1.5
- Aim for a TWR on the second stage of 0.7-0.9
- For engine choices, TWR is just as important if not more so than Isp (within reason - don't use Mastodons as your upper stage engines)

## Flight

- Start your gravity turn a few seconds after launch and then lock in prograde hold
- If you have to cut off your engines or adjust throttle at all because you reach an apoapsis >80km before raising periapsis above 0km then you need to be more aggressive with your gravity turn.
- Holding 5° pitch once above 30km (never pitch off prograde before 30km) to circularize is okay as long as your angle of attack doesn't get much higher than a few degrees. Otherwise you were too aggressive with your gravity turn.

General guidelines for gravity turn

- TWR 1.3: 150m/s by 80° and 12km by 45°
- TWR 1.4: 120m/s by 80° and 9km by 45°
- TWR 1.5: 100m/s by 80° and 7km by 45°

Between 90 and 80° is where I tune my gravity turn, after that, lock in prograde hold til orbit. Once you get over 36km the navball will automatically switch from surface to orbit mode, quick switch it back and stay in surface prograde hold to minimize drag.
